To interact with Mantle testnet, you can rely on the same popular node providers that you are already using on Ethereum. There are multiple providers that may help you build on Mantle, here is a list of a couple of them.

## [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=mantle-docs)

Alchemy provides endpoints for both Mantle One (Mainnet) and Rinkeby testnet. To use these RPC endpoints, you need to create a free account and set up an **_Alchemy API key_** to authenticate your requests. For detailed steps of how to create one, see the [Alchemy's documentation](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/introduction/getting-started#1.create-an-alchemy-key).

Next, depending one which network you want to interact with, you can choose between the two RPC endpoints provided by Alchemy and interact with them directly in the command line or point your [wallet's](https://portal.mantle.one/#wallets) RPC endpoints to them. For more information on Mantle JSON-RPC API methods supported by Alchemy, check out the [official documentation](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/apis/mantle).

Alchemy provides 300M compute units per month for free, or the equivalent of 30M getLatestBlock requests. Additional usage requires upgrading to a Growth Tier (\$49 / month).

## [Infura](https://infura.io/)

Infura is a node service provider that provides access to Mantle One (Mainnet), Goerli testnet and Rinkeby testnet. To start interacting with either of these networks, you need to [set up an Infura account](https://infura.io/register) and create a new key. For detailed steps, check out Infura's [documentation](https://docs.infura.io/infura/networks/mantle).

Infura provides access to Mantle across all their subscription plans (Core Free, Developer, Team & Growth). See [pricing & daily request rate limits](https://infura.io/pricing).

## [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/)

QuickNode supports Mantle One Mainnet, Goerli and Rinkeby testnet, as well as Mantle Nova Mainnet, and allows users to interact with these chains.

For a full guide of how to use an Mantle node on QuickNode, see the [QuickNode's Mantle](https://www.quicknode.com/docs/mantle) and [Quicknode's Mantle Nova documentation](https://www.quicknode.com/docs/mantle-nova).

[Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/accounts/new-signup) provides 10 million API credits per month for Mantle for free.

## [Moralis](https://moralis.io/)

Moralis allows Mantle users and developers to connect to both Mantle One (Mainnet) and Rinkeby testnet. To do so, you need to create an account and choose the node you wish to connect to. You will then be presented with a pair of URLs (Mantle Mainnet and Testnet) with which you can interact with directly in the command line or point your [wallet's](https://portal.mantle.one/#wallets) RPC endpoints to them. For full guide and more explanation, see the [Moralis's documentation](https://moralis.io/full-guide-how-to-connect-to-mantle-nodes/).

## [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/)

Ankr provides access to both Mantle One (Mainnet) and Rinkeby Testnet. After creating an Ankr account, you will be presented with a pair of URLs which you can use to connect to any of our networks. For more details, see the [Ankr's documentation](https://docs.ankr.com/blockchains/mantle/develop-on-mantle).

## [BlockVision](https://blockvision.org/)

BlockVision provides Mantle One mainnet and Rinkeby node services. See [BlockVision Dashboard](https://dashboard.blockvision.org/connect).

## [GetBlock](https://getblock.io/)

GetBlock is a service that provides instant API connection to full nodes of many leading blockchain networks, including Mantle One (Mainnet) available for shared and dedicated nodes and Rinkeby Testnet available for dedicated nodes.

For detailed steps on how to set up an Mantle node, check [GetBlock’s documentation](https://getblock.io/docs/)

GetBlock’s pricing for Mantle starts from \$6 for 500K requests. Also, GetBlock offers a free plan for testing.

## [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/)

Chainstack currently supports the Mantle Goerli testnet and Mantle One Mainnet (including Archive node support).

See [documentation](https://chainstack.com/build-better-with-mantle/) for more info.
