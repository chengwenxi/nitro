# Getting Started

Welcome to Mantle! Here's how to become an Mantle user:

_**Note: before interacting with a mainnet chain, users should familiarize themselves with the risks; see [Mainnet Beta](mainnet-beta)**_.

#### Connect Your Wallet

Connect [your wallet](https://portal.mantle.one/#wallets) to an Mantle chain, adding the chain's RPC endpoint if required.

#### Get Some Native Currency

You'll need a chain's native currency to transact. You can either acquire funds directly on an Mantle chain, or get funds on a chain's underlying L1 and bridge it across. You can get testnet Ether from the following faucets:

- [Goerli](https://goerlifaucet.com/)
- [Rinkeby](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/)
- [Nitro Goerli Rollup](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=ok%20I%20need%20@mantle%20to%20give%20me%20Nitro%20testnet%20gas.%20like%20VERY%20SOON.%20I%20cant%20take%20this,%20I%E2%80%99ve%20been%20waiting%20for%20@nitro_devnet%20release.%20I%20just%20want%20to%20start%20developing.%20but%20I%20need%20the%20gas%20IN%20MY%20WALLET%20NOW.%20can%20devs%20DO%20SOMETHING??%20%20SEND%20HERE:%200xAddA0B73Fe69a6E3e7c1072Bb9523105753e08f8)

[Supported centralized exchanges](https://portal.mantle.one/#centralizedexchanges) allow you to purchase (mainnet) Ether and withdraw it directly onto Mantle one.

#### Deposit And Withdraw

To move your Ether and Tokens between Mantle and Ethereum chains, visit [bridge.mantle.io](https://bridge.mantle.io/).

#### Use L2 Dapps!

Interacting with Mantle chains will feel very similar to using Ethereum, just cheaper and faster! To get a sense of what's out there, you can check out our [portal page](https://portal.mantle.one/), where we showcase some of the dApps, wallets, and infrastructure currently live on Mantle One.

#### Build on Mantle

Dapp developers can [build on Mantle seamlessly](getting-started-devs) using their favorite Ethereum tooling.

The team working on Mantle is always interested and looking forward to engage with its users.
